# Forensics Datasets (Download Links + Notes)

This program uses practice datasets for learning DFIR workflows.

## Important
- Use datasets with clear licenses/permission for educational use.
- Do **not** upload copyrighted vendor materials or restricted datasets to this repository.
- Prefer linking to the canonical source + include hashes where possible.

## Suggested datasets (examples)
- Digital Corpora (various corpora): https://digitalcorpora.org/
- NIST CFReDS (Computer Forensic Reference Data Sets): https://www.nist.gov/itl/ssd/software-quality-group/computer-forensics-reference-data-sets-cfreds

## Local handling
If an instructor provides USB images or case materials, they should be distributed via approved college channels (LMS/shared drive) and referenced here by:
- dataset name
- version/date
- expected file hash
