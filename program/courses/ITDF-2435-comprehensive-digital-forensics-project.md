# ITDF-2435 — Comprehensive Digital Forensics Project (Course Card)

## What this is
A capstone-style forensics project course focused on applying digital forensics end-to-end: scoping, acquisition/collection strategy, analysis, reporting, and presentation.

## What students produce
- A structured investigation plan
- Evidence inventory + chain-of-custody style notes (mock/sanitized)
- Findings report (executive summary + technical appendix)
- Brief-out presentation (10–15 minutes)

## Repo resources
- Forensics datasets: `labs/forensics/datasets.md`

## NICE-aligned sample labs (examples)
These sample labs align to core NICE work role tasks in **Incident Response** and **Digital Forensics**.
- **Case scoping + collection plan:** define scope, evidence sources, and collection order-of-operations for a mock incident.
- **Intrusion artifact collection:** identify and collect intrusion artifacts from a provided dataset (logs, triage outputs), then justify what you collected.
- **After Action Review (AAR):** write an AAR with what went well, what failed, and prioritized improvements.

## Notes
- Use sanitized datasets and mock scenarios only.
- Writeups should be reproducible and should not include sensitive content.
