# ITSY-2301 — Firewalls and Network Security (Course Card)

## What students learn (plain English)
- Configure firewall policies with least privilege.
- Understand segmentation, NAT, and rule evaluation.
- Validate controls with testing and logging.

## Suggested lab themes
- Build a simple segmented network and prove segmentation with packet capture.
- Create an allowlist policy and document exceptions.
- Implement logging and demonstrate how to investigate a blocked vs allowed flow.

## NICE-aligned sample labs (examples)
These sample labs align to core NICE work role tasks in **Network Operations** and **Infrastructure Support**.
- **Firewall rulebase + change control:** implement a least-privilege policy, document the request/approval, then validate outcomes in logs.
- **VPN + access control:** configure a VPN scenario (lab-only), enforce ACLs, and validate who can reach what.
- **Patch/upgrade drill (network devices):** simulate a network device OS update, validate services, and document rollback steps.

## Notes
- Keep configurations sanitized. Do not publish real org IPs, VPN configs, or credentials.
