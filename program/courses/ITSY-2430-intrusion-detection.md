# ITSY-2430 — Intrusion Detection (Course Card)

## What students learn (plain English)
- What “good logs” look like and how detections are built.
- How to write basic detection logic and tune false positives.
- How to triage alerts and communicate impact.

## Suggested lab themes
- Build a simple detection for authentication anomalies.
- Create a network-based alert (e.g., suspicious DNS patterns).
- Build an alert triage checklist and test it with sample data.

## Notes
- Focus on explainability: what the alert means, what to check next, and why.
