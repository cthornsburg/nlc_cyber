# ITSY-2430 — Intrusion Detection (Course Card)

## What students learn (plain English)
- What “good logs” look like and how detections are built.
- How to write basic detection logic and tune false positives.
- How to triage alerts and communicate impact.

## Suggested lab themes
- Build a simple detection for authentication anomalies.
- Create a network-based alert (e.g., suspicious DNS patterns).
- Build an alert triage checklist and test it with sample data.

## NICE-aligned sample labs (examples)
These sample labs align to core NICE work role tasks in **Defensive Cybersecurity** and **Incident Response**.
- **Validate IDS alerts:** ingest sample alerts, determine false positive vs actionable, and document rationale.
- **Network anomaly analysis:** analyze a packet capture / flow logs for suspicious patterns (DNS, beaconing, scans) and write a short report.
- **Triage + escalation:** take a mock alert through triage, scope/impact assessment, and escalation with a clean handoff note.

## Notes
- Focus on explainability: what the alert means, what to check next, and why.
