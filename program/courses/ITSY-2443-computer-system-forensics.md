# ITSY-2443 — Computer System Forensics (Course Card)

## What students learn (plain English)
- Collect and preserve evidence without making it worse.
- Perform basic endpoint triage and artifact review.
- Document findings clearly enough to brief a technical lead *and* a non-technical stakeholder.

## Repo resources (start here)
- Datasets reference: `labs/forensics/datasets.md`
- Labs index: `labs/README.md`

## Suggested student deliverables (portfolio-friendly)
- A sanitized case report template + a sample report (no real PII/case data)
- A timeline log for a mock incident

## NICE-aligned sample labs (examples)
These sample labs align to core NICE work role tasks in **Incident Response** and **Digital Forensics**.
- **Forensically sound collection:** acquire a disk/memory image from a provided VM/dataset, verify hashes, and document chain-of-custody style notes.
- **Artifact triage:** analyze common endpoint artifacts (processes, persistence, event logs, browser history) and produce a short findings memo.
- **Timeline build:** create a timeline from artifacts and answer: what happened, when, and what evidence supports it.

## Notes
- This repo is public. Do not upload real case data, credentials, or any restricted material.
