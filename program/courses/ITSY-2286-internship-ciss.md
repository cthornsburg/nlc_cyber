# ITSY-2286 — Internship: Computer and Information Systems Security (Course Card)

## What this internship emphasizes
- Professional workflow: ticketing, documentation, and stakeholder communication.
- Realistic security operations tasks under supervision.
- Deliverables that can become a portfolio (sanitized).

## Capstone project options (current)

### 1) Regional SOC (hybrid: student interns + paid professionals)
**Concept:** a regional Security Operations Center model to support K-12 ISDs in the area.

Student-aligned workstreams (examples):
- Alert triage playbooks and escalation rules
- Detection tuning and documentation
- Basic incident intake + timeline building
- Weekly reporting (executive-friendly)

### 2) Security assessments for local orgs and smaller municipalities
**Concept:** offer structured assessments with clear outputs and remediation roadmaps.

Student-aligned workstreams (examples):
- Interview guide + evidence request list
- Risk register and prioritized findings
- "90-day starter plan" remediation roadmap
- Final readout deck (executive summary + appendix)

## NICE-aligned sample labs (examples)
These are portfolio-friendly deliverables that align to NICE work role tasks in **Defensive Cybersecurity**, **Network Operations**, **Infrastructure Support**, and **Incident Response**.
- **Daily operations report:** a repeatable daily/weekly security report template (events, trends, actions, blockers).
- **Incident intake + triage packet:** intake form + triage checklist + timeline log for a mock incident.
- **Control validation:** verify a security control is working (logging, segmentation, MFA) and write a short validation memo.

## What success looks like
- Clear documentation for every task
- Repeatable artifacts (templates, checklists, playbooks)
- A professional final brief-out

## Notes
- All client material must be treated as sensitive. Do not upload client data into this public repo.
